# nodecg-smashcontrol
----

nodecg-smashcontrol is a bundle for NodeCG that will help Smash Bros. tournament streamers efficiently change player names, character icons and place in braceket.

#### Proposed Features
* Change Player names, character icons and score to output to the stream via html/css.
* Different modes for each Smash game, each with their own package of character icons.
* Use of smash.gg and Challonge's APIs to load and display sets.


#### Credits
This program is currently being written by [swc19](https://github.com/swc19) and is inspired by both [Scoreboard Assistant](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/scoreboard-assistant.112/) and [nodecg-speedcontrol](https://github.com/speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol).
